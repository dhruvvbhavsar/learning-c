Whisper, echo
Vast skies bloom
Tiny ants march
Colossal mountains loom
Zephyrs dance
Quaint village sleeps
Vibrant butterflies flit
As old willow weeps
Autumn leaves fall
Distant thunder rumbles
Owl's nocturnal call
Time's pendulum swings
Fleeting moments pass
Life's tapestry unfolds
On dewdrops and grass
